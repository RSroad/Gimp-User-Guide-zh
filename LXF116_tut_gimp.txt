Gimp: A Bottle
With a blur, a colourise and some guides, Michael J Hammel uses
digital aging to add style and credits the the wine bottle project.
The Lower Band layer is used for both the angled bottom
and wide lower band components of the cap.

This second part of the realistic wine bottle tutorial will
add the final details that make the wine bottle really
come to life. This includes adding a bottle cap along
with integrating some text, adding clip art and merging some
creative photography with the labels. Before we dive into
these though, let’s review what we learned last month in the
first part of the tutorial.
The most important lesson from last month’s tutorial
focused on using Gimp’s guides and grid for precise
measures and alignment. The outline of the bottle used
guides to place anchors for curved paths. Highlights created
with the Gradient tool in multiple layers were aligned by
simply bounding mouse drags with guides. and guide
intersections made it easy to position project layers. The
guides were positioned to overlap Gimp’s grid so that the
Snap To Grid option would make it easier to drop anchors and
create selections by referencing the guide intersection points.
Symmetry is your friend
Drawing the a line across the
bottom of the cap enhances
the bottom edge of the cap.
Another trick from the first part of this tutorial was to draw
half a bottle, then duplicate and flip it to complete the whole.
Also, colour in each project layer was kept consistent by using
greyscale gradients and tinting these with exact values in the
Colourise dialog. And finally, we set the Levels dialog using
specific input values, rather than referencing inexact settings
for the input sliders.
Only a few tools were used to create the 3D bottle in the
first part of this tutorial. This next part uses a few more Gimp
features, but these steps won’t all be so precisely set with
guides. Text layers and clip art will be aligned manually, using
nothing more than your own eyes for positioning. Fortunately,
the most complex component of the bottle – the bottle cap –
can be created using the same guide-based methods from
part one of the tutorial.
Last month We drew the shape of the bottle, then gave it depth and a label.

Many of the details in the cap will only be appreciated
when viewed with the final image as a whole.
This month the wine bottle will get a bottle cap, some
floral glass etching, and label lettering and imagery. The
techniques you take from this tutorial should help you
become more adept at repeating processes that you can use
in any project.
Before we start, be sure to reset the foreground and
background colours to black/white respectively. All text used
in this part of the tutorial will be based on common fonts
found in all current Linux distributions. Also, immediately
after opening last month’s project file, save the project as a
new name, so if you mess up you can always go back to the
last tutorial’s image and try again.
the image window in from the guide intersections at 380/70
to 380/65.
Choose the Rectangle Select tool from the Toolbox.
Working in the same layer, drag a selection from the
intersection of guides at 365/40 to 435/70. This will
temporarily overlap the gradient from the last step. Hit Enter
to accept this selection. Round the corners of the selection
(Select > Rounded Rectangle) by 50%. In the Tool Options
dialog, set the Mode to Subtract. Drag a selection from the
guides intersecting at 365/65 to 435/70. Hit Enter to use this
selection to cut off the bottom of the first selection.
Choose the Gradient tool from the Toolbox. In the Tool
Options dialog set the Shape to Bi-linear and click on the
Reverse button. Drag from the guides interesting at 390/45 to
435/45. Clear all selections (Ctrl+Shift+A or Select > None).
Open the Colourise dialog (Colours > Colourise) and set the
Hue to 50, the Saturation to 86 and the Lightness to 0.
In the layers dialog, set the Lock Alpha Channel button.
This will ensure that transparent pixels stay transparent as we
complete this part of the tutorial. Choose the Paintbrush from
the Toolbox. Click on the Reset button in the Tool Options
dialog. Set the Mode to Overlay and choose the Circle (03)
brush, then set the Use Colour from Gradient button and
choose the FG to BG (RGB) gradient. Click on the Reverse
button, set the Length to 50 pixels, and in the image window
draw from Guide intersection at 365/65 to 435/65
The wide lower band of the cap now gets a strip of writing.
Choose the Text Tool from the Toolbox. Set the Font to Serif
Bold Italic, the size to eight pixels and the colour to Black.
The band was
blurred to soften
the ridges, giving
them a rounded
appearance.
Wine bottle cap
The bottle cap is made up of four distinct parts:
An angled bottom.
A wide lower band.
Text in the lower band.
A ridged upper band.
The cap will require a new set of guides (you should still have
the guides from part one in your project). Add three vertical
guides (Image > Guides > New Guide) at 365, 380, and 435.
Add four horizontal guides at 35, 45, 65 and 70. Zoom in
(Shift +) so that the top of the bottle and all of the gold
wrapper are visible.
Add a layer to the project and call it Lower Band. Choose
the Path tool from Gimp’s Toolbox. Click on the guide
intersections at 370/70, 365/65, 435/65, and 430/70. In the
Tool Options dialog, click on the Selection from Path button,
then choose the Gradient tool from the Toolbox. Click on the
Reset button at the bottom of the Tool Options dialog. Drag

Set the Shape to Bi-linear and the Repeat to Triangular Wave.
If the Dithering option is not set, click on it. Drag from the
guides intersection at 400/45 to 390/45.
Open the Colourise dialog and set the Hue to 50, the
Saturation to 86 and the Lightness to 0, then apply this to the
selection. Once again, enable the Lock Alpha Channel for this
layer in the Layers dialog. Open the Motion Blur (Filters > Blur

apply the blur. In the Layers dialog, move the Upper Band

We’ll have to position the text by hand, so turn off the
Snap To Guides option (View > Snap to Guides). Use the
Move tool to drag the layer into the centre of the Lower Band.
Once positioned, turned the Snap To Guides back on.
Choose the Shear Tool from the Toolbox. Click in the
image window to open the Shear dialog. Set the Shear
Magnitude Y to -7 and click on the Shear button to apply the
effect. Turn on the Layer Lock Alpha Channel. Set the
Foreground colour to Red 171, Green 151 and
Blue 57. Drag this colour from the FG box in
the Toolbox to the image window to colour
the text. Set the layer mode for the text
layer to Multiply and the Opacity to 70%.
The next thing we’re going to do is add a
ridged upper band to the top of the cap.
Add a layer to the image (Layer > New) and
call it Upper Band. Choose the Rectangle
